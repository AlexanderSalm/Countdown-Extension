# Countdown-Extension

This extension adds a countdown timer to the GNOME Shell top panel. This extension can be configured either by clicking on the icon in the top panel, or through the extension settings. 

## Installation

Download the zip file "countdown@alikay" from the latest releases tab. Extract this zip file into ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ . If there is no extensions folder inside of gnome-shell, you should install the GNOME extensions app. Once the extension is in place, press Alt + F2 to bring up the GNOME shell terminal, and then enter "r" (without the quotes) to restart the GNOME shell. If on Wayland, you will need to log out and log back in, as the restart command is not available.
